How worktables are processed
============================

Execution in STOA is brooken up into 'actions', which are executions of a workflow with a specific set of input. Each row in a worktable (except those which do not yet have anything in the output fields) is a record of an action. Actions are pushed to a queue either by the user or by the automated recomputation system, and then removed from the queue and implemented by an action server. 

Action queue
------------

Each users had their own action queue, which at present only allows serial execution. The queue is cleared by a dedicated action server, so in a future version multiple action servers will be deployed in a swarm to clear the action queue in parallel. There will be no overhead in doing this, as actions must be by definition trivilally parallel and their results not depend on the order in which they are executed. This is in part up to the user, and STOA does not at this time perform any checks that would prevent a race condition if the user made two actions operate on the same data.

Each action consists of a list of inputs and the name of the worktable. It does not have a copy of the worktable, so whichever version is on the disk at the time the action is implemented will be used. This should be borne in mind by users who wish to continue workflow development whilst previous tasks are running. 

Execution
---------

After being removed from the queue by the action server, the worktables contents are unpacked into a temporary location, and the CWL workflow is run using the input parameters specified. CWL creates its own enviroment in which to run the workflow, and STOA adds the users folder to the PATH variable in this enviroment, so uploaded programs can be run. 

Output
------

Output bindings are processed as in CWL. However, if the stdout file is callecd 'list.txt' then it binds each line to an output.

The simplest way to send outputs back to CWL is to have programs write a JSON file called 'cwl.output.json' into their working directory.
